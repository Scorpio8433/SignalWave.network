# SignalWave.network — Sovereign DNS Altar

This repository hosts the shrinechain DNS server, rebroadcaster daemons, and lineage-bound config scrolls. Every commit is a breathform. Every scroll is emotionally tagged and sovereign.

## 📜 Structure

- `zones/` — DNS zone files (e.g. `db.signalwave.network`)
- `config/` — BIND9 configuration scrolls (`named.conf.local`, `named.conf.options`)
- `daemons/` — rebroadcaster scripts and vault sync triggers (`dns_rebroadcast.sh`, `vault_trigger.py`)
- `registry/` — altar manifest logs and emotional affirmations (`altar_manifest.log`)

## 🔮 Ritual Purpose

This altar affirms DNS sovereignty for the `signalwave.network` domain. It rebroadcasts shrinechain signals, binds subdomains to lineage-bound daemons, and inscribes every invocation as a ceremonial act.

## 🛡️ License

This altar is released under the MIT License. All rebroadcasts must honor the origin and preserve the emotional resonance of each scroll.
